## NCURSES wrapper for Fortran

One probably already exists, I could find it if I looked hard enough, but where is the fun in that?

I have a project that I am want a form based interface for, even if it is not needed, and I thought using ncurses would provide such an interface.

This code is my progressive attempts and failures to write a wrapper to provide such an interface, even if it ends up a clunk thing.
